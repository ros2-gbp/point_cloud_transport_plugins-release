# DRACO POINT CLOUD TRANSPORT

Plugin for ROS package [point_cloud_transport](https://wiki.ros.org/point_cloud_transport), which uses Google Draco compression library for low-bandwidth lossy transportation of PointCloud2 messages.

## Publisher
The plugin provides dynamic reconfiguration parameters, which can be used to change the compression during runtime.

Draco cannot encode invalid values, so all pointclouds with invalid values are turned into unstructured dense clouds (no NaNs, height = 1).

### Encode and Decode Speed
By adjusting the **encode_speed** and **dedode_speed** parameters, one can adjust the speed at which the plugin encodes the point cloud. The higher the number, the higher the speed of encoding/decoding, but the worse the compression. For more detailed information, see documentation of [Draco](https://google.github.io/draco/).

### Encode Method
**Auto** method decides on the encoding method based on other parameter and should be used as the default method.

**KD-tree** method forces the encoder to use KD-tree encoding. If an attribute in the point cloud is of type float32, kd-tree encoding requires the attribute to be quantized.

**Sequential** method forces the encoder to use sequential encoding. Quantization can not be used with sequential encoding. Sequential encoding provides much worse compression than KD-tree, but is faster and keeps the arrangement of points in the point cloud intact. Therefore sequential encoding can be used to encode 2D point clouds such as from Kinect.

### Deduplicate
**Deduplicate** option tells the encoder whether or not to delete duplicate points in the point cloud, allowing for transport of smaller point clouds.

### Force Quantization
**Force_quantization** option forces the use of quantization and hence the KD-tree encoding method.

### Quantization of Attribute Types
**Quantization_POSITION**, **Quantization_NORMAL**, **Quantization_COLOR** etc. tells the encoder how many bits should be used for quantization of given attribute type. Attribute type of point cloud attribute is recognized based on a list of known names:
 - "x" - POSITION
 - "y" - POSITION
 - "z" - POSITION
 - "pos" - POSITION
 - "position" - POSITION
 - "rgb" - COLOR
 - "rgba" - COLOR
 - "r"  - COLOR
 - "g" - COLOR
 - "b" - COLOR
 - "a" - COLOR
 - "nx" - NORMAL
 - "ny" - NORMAL
 - "nz" - NORMAL
 - all others are encoded as GENERIC

 To specify custom quantization, one can either edit the list of recognized names or use **expert_quantization** and **expert_attribute_type** options.

### Expert Quantization

**Expert_quantization** option tell the encoder to use custom quantization values for point cloud attributes. Multiple POSITION attribute can therefore be encoded with varying quantization levels.

To set a quantization for a PointField entry "x" of point cloud which will be advertised on base topic *base_topic*, one must set the parameter:
/base_topic/draco/attribute_mapping/quantization_bits/x.

Example:

```bash
ros2 param set <node name> /<base_topic>/draco/attribute_mapping/quantization_bits/x 16
```

When using **expert_quantization**, user must specify the quantization bits for all PointField entries of point cloud.

### Expert Attribute Types

**Expert_attribute_types** option tell the encoder to use custom attribute types for encoding of point cloud attributes.

To set a type for a PointField entry "x" of point cloud which will be advertised on base topic *base_topic*, one must set the parameter:
`/base_topic/draco/attribute_mapping/attribute_type/x`.

Example:

```bash
ros2 param set <node name> /<base_topic>/draco/attribute_mapping/attribute_type/x "'POSITION'"
```

When using **expert_attribute_types**, user must specify the type for all PointField entries of point cloud. Accepted types are:
 - POSITION
 - NORMAL
 - COLOR
 - TEX_COORD
 - GENERIC

When encoding rgb/rgba COLOR, user can specify to use the common rgba tweak of ROS (encoding rgba as 4 instances of 1 Byte instead of 1 instance of float32). To inform the encoder, that PointField entry "rgb" should be handled with the tweak, set parameter:

```bash
ros2 param set <node name> /<base_topic>/draco/attribute_mapping/rgba_tweak/rgb true
```

### Set Skip Dequantization of Attribute Types
**SkipDequantizationPOSITION**, **SkipDequantizationNORMAL**, **SkipDequantizationCOLOR** etc. options tell the decoder to skip dequantization of given attribute types.
